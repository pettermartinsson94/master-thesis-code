The code used in my master's thesis "To fight for Europe: Public support for military intervention in Ukraine"

To set up the data for analysis replication, follow the steps indicated below:

1. Download the two datasets from the SiE project page. The 2023 dataset can be found [here](https://search.gesis.org/research_data/SDN-10.7802-2646?doi=10.7802/2646), and the 2022 dataset can be found [here](https://search.gesis.org/research_data/SDN-10.7802-2506?doi=10.7802/2506). The datasets are labeled "2023_SiE_dataset_dataset_labels.csv" and "Dataset.csv", and can be found by pressing the "Datasets" button under the "Downloads" section.

2. Convert the files to .xlsx and label them "2023_SiE.xlsx" and "2022_SiE.xlsx".

3. Place the two files in the working directory.

4. Run the code provided in the markdown file labeled "Petter Martinsson".

AI disclaimer: Parts of the code have been troubleshooted with the aid of GPT-4.
